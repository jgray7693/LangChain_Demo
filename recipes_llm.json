Once the pan is very hot, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter, and heat them together for another full minute. Arrange chicken skin side down and cook until deeply brown underneath, about 4 to 5 minutes. [Don’t crowd the chicken; depending on the size of your pan, you might need to do this in two batches.] While it browns, season what is now the top side with additional salt and pepper. Once browned, flip the pieces over and brown on the second side, about another 3 to 4 minutes. Don’t skimp on the color, please. Transfer the chicken to a plate.",

Cook the onions for about 15 minutes total, or until golden throughout and darker brown at the edges, stirring every couple minutes. In the beginning, the onions are watery; once the water has cooked off and the onions begin to pick up color, I reduce the heat to medium for the remaining time. Carefully taste and season with more salt, if desired, and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Remove 1/3 cup of onions and set aside until the end.",

Carefully pour 2 cups (updated amount) of the broth around chicken. Bring the pan to a simmer then reduce to the lowest simmer and cover. Cook rice and chicken together for 25 minutes, or until rice is tender. If rice is not tender at 25 minutes, add remaining 1/4 cup broth and return to the heat for another 5 to 10 minute4s.",

I reheat it covered in an oven-safe dish at 350 degrees for 15 to 30 minutes, until the chicken is warm.

Using your finger, brush another dab of water on one corner (of the filling side), and gently overlap the two corners of the rectangle by pressing them together. Place on the parchment-lined sheet pan. Make one more wonton, boil, and taste test the two samples (we find that tasting two, and not just one, helps us get a better feel for the flavor and adjust seasoning more accurately). Make adjustments to taste before proceeding to make the whole batch.",
            "To cook the wontons, boil water in a pot, and add the wontons (fresh or frozen, but never defrosted wontons). To prevent the wontons from sticking to the bottom of the pot, stir the boiling water gently so the water is moving when you add in the wontons. Cook uncovered for abou 5 minutes using medium heat. If necessary, add ½ cup cold water if the water is boiling too vigorously. This helps manage the starch levels in the water. The wontons are done once they float to the surface and turn slightly plump. (Cooking frozen wontons takes longer, about 8 minutes.)"

Use a wooden spoon to stir the mixture together. Bring to a gentle boil, breaking up the blueberries with the back of a wooden spoon as they cook. Cook mixture, stirring frequently, for approximately 5 to 10 minutes total, until the mixture is thick like jelly and coats the back of the spoon. The thicker it is, the less likely it will be to spill out of the rolls when you roll them up. Set mixture aside to cool completely.",
            "Prepare the dough: In the bowl of an eclectic mixer, or if making by hand, a large bowl, add the sugar and lemon zest. Use clean hands to rub the zest into the sugar for approximately 30 seconds to release and infuse lemon flavor into the sugar. In a small microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, warm the milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds to 1 minute, until it registers 115°F on a thermometer and feels like very warm bath water (but it shouldn’t be too hot!). Add the warmed milk into the bowl with the sugar and sprinkle the yeast on top. Wait 3 to 5 minutes to activate the yeast; you will know it is activated when it starts to bubble and foam on top. Add the egg, egg yolk and melted butter. Mix on medium speed until well combined, 30 seconds. (Alternatively, mix with a wooden spoon until well combined.) Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a wooden spoon to stir in the flour and salt until a dough begins to form (this will prevent flour from flying everywhere!).",
            "Knead the dough: Place the dough hook on the stand mixer and return the bowl to the mixer. Knead the dough on medium speed, 8 to 10 minutes. (Alternatively, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes on a well-floured surface.) Please know that this is a sticky dough, but if measured properly they will bake up beautifully! Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil. Transfer the dough ball to the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and the warm towel. Allow the dough to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (This may be more or less time depending on the time of year, the humidity, and the temperature in your home.) You will know the dough has risen enough when you poke your finger into the dough about an inch without the indentation bouncing back immediately.",

Using a spatula or spoon, evenly spread the blueberry filling all over the dough. Starting from the short side (the 10 inch side) without the margin, very tightly roll up the dough. Seal the far edge of the dough as best you can by pinching the dough together just slightly, then make sure the dough log is seam-side down. Cut a ½-inch off the ends of the dough, as the ends won’t have enough filling; feel free to discard (or bake separately as yummy extras). Use your hands to give the dough log a gentle push inwards on both ends so that it compacts slightly, as it may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process. Using unflavored dental floss or a serrated knife, cut the dough into nine 1-inch slices.",
            "Line a round or square 9-inch pan with parchment paper. Place the rolls in the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let rise again until the rolls have puffed up, are doubled in size, and touch each other in the pan, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F. Once the rolls have risen, remove the plastic wrap and towel and bake until just golden brown on the edges, about 20 to 25 minutes. Not overbaking the rolls ensures that they will stay soft in the middle.",
            "While the rolls bake, prepare the lemon cream cheese frosting: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine the cream cheese, butter, powdered sugar, lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Beat on low speed to start, then increase to medium-high speed and mix until smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2 minutes. (Alternatively, whisk the frosting by hand.) Immediately spread the frosting over the rolls so the frosting gets into every little nook and cranny of the roll and then serve. ENJOY!",
            "To store: cover the cooled cinnamon rolls with plastic wrap and foil or place individual cinnamon rolls in airtight glass containers or silicone bags and store in the fridge for up to 5 days.
